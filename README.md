Contact Tracing - Iceland

**Rakning C-19** developed by Aranja for the Directorate of Health. Decentralized solution that relies on GPS location (no proximity tracing via Bluetooth). It requires phone number validation, as anti-abuse measure & for contact purposes.

The app works indeed as a path/location tracer. The app collects the GPS location of the phone and stores it only locally on the device. 

Only if the phone owner is diagnosed with the Covid-19 disease he is asked by the Directorate of Health to share the location data for contact tracing in order to identify individuals that might need to go into quarantine.
